    development.
  * d/watch: Only watch for 2.x versions.
    The upstream 'main' branch now targets SDL 3 (under development), and
    should be packaged separately as a libsdl3-image source package.

      This is deliberate, as per upstream commit 31ce11c5.

libsdl2-image (2.0.5+dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * d/p/showimage-Add-a-quit-option.patch:
    Add patch to add a -quit option to the showimage example.
    This allows it to be used as a non-interactive smoke-test.
  * d/tests: Add an autopkgtest using the modified showimage.
    Taken from the libsdl2-image package in the Steam Runtime.
  * Add a .symbols file
  * Re-export upstream signing key without extra signatures.
  * Drop transition for old debug package migration.
  * d/rules: Rely on debhelper compat 12 for dh_makeshlibs.
    With a .symbols file, the version passed to dh_makeshlibs is only a
    fallback.
    debhelper compat level 12 defaults to generating dependencies on the
    current upstream version, which is what's in stable. More relaxed
    dependencies aren't particularly useful, because we don't support
    skipping a release anyway.
  * d/rules: Remove unnecessary override for dh_compress.
    debhelper compat level 12 doesn't compress examples anyway.
  * Use debhelper compat level 13.
    Drop dh_missing --fail-missing override: this is now the default.
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (no changes required)
